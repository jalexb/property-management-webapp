   whos gonna work on the database

   Work to get the framing setup.



   one person is assigned to one card at a single time
   It's a piece, a chunk that everyone works on individually


   A card should be a day or half a day.

   Build out cards based on being finished in a day/half day
   Make cards for the entire sprint week.
   Every individual can look at the cards to see where people are at.


   Some groups work in teams for the first few days, bang out the database
   and the front end. After that they work individually

   Make some labels for different parts of the code
   Database is a label,
   front-end is a label
   apis is a label
